# Hey, I'm Thomas

Appreciate you stopping by. I'm a Computer Science student at WGU and I work at Micro Center helping people fix tech issues — everything from Ubiquiti setups to weird OS bugs. I also like building stuff when I’m off the clock.

## 🔧 Stuff I’m Into

- Helping people figure out their tech, even if they don’t know what a router is
- Making tools that actually help — like a bill tracker I use myself
- Still learning more about backend stuff and cloud tech, picking it up as I go
- I’ve got CompTIA A+ and ITIL Foundations under my belt, just keep stacking it

## 📁 Some Projects

- **[Bill Tracker](https://github.com/boshans/billTracker)**  
  A custom-themed finance tracker I built — does balances, lets me track bills, and runs as an installer.

- **[Vacation Booking API](https://github.com/boshans/vacation-booking-api)**  
  Java backend for a travel site — connects to an Angular frontend from school.

- **[MJ Logistics CRM](https://github.com/boshans/mj-logistics-crm)**  
  Mapped out a CRM for a logistics company. Wrote up all the user stories, features, and hosting setup.

- **[Landon Hotel Project](https://github.com/boshans/landon-hotel-modernization)**  
  Took a hotel app and made it support French, different currencies, and time zones. Dockerized it too.
